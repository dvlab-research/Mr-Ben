        "Step 1: Analyzing Choice A - Directed mutation",
        "Directed mutation suggests that gene mutations occurpurposefully in response to environmental pressures. However, genetic mutations are random events and not directed towards any specific adaptive outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the gene pool of the newly established population of birds reflects the effects of directed mutation.",
        "Step 2: Analyzing Choice B - Genetic drift",
        "Genetic drift is the random change in the frequency of genes in a small population due to chance events. Since the population of birds that colonized the island is small and isolated, it is likely to experience genetic drift. This means that the gene pool of the population may become increasingly different from the original population due to the random loss or fixation of certain alleles.",

        "Adaptive radiation is the diversification of a species into multiple new forms, each adapted to a different ecological niche.

Here n = 2 (since v^2), so the uncertainty in v^2 = 2 * 10% = 20%. However, kinetic energy K = (1/2)mv^2, thus the proportional factor of 1/2 should also be considered for the uncertainty in K, making it also 20%. The propagation of uncertainty was correctly calculated, but it needs careful explanation of multiplying factors, particularly in power functions, which was skipped or assumed known here. Thus, the correct uncertainty in K remains 20% and not double the uncertainty of v. Therefore, the propagation in Step 4 itself isn't incorrect as earlier indicated; the error lies more in Step 5's failure to critically assess if other factors like proportionality constants (which there aren't any affecting the result) could alter the uncertainty propagation. However, the initial claim that Step 4 is incorrect in its propagation process was wrong, the method used was right, and thus the selected answer (D) is also correct.

When a quantity like speed (v) is squared in a formula, the percentage uncertainty is calculated as [(1±0.1)v]^2. Thus, if the uncertainty in v is 10%, the uncertainty in v^2 (and hence in kinetic energy, since kinetic energy is proportional to v^2) should be around 20%. Thus, the correct answer should be Choice D: 20%."
